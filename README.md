# advent of py
I started using [python](https://www.python.org/) on 2008, so I'm using
this repo to showcase my skills with it by solving the
[advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/).

# how to use it
```buildoutcfg
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

# test
after installing `requirements.txt` run
```buildoutcfg
pytest
```
